To run an `.ipynb` file (Jupyter Notebook file), follow these steps based on your environment:

---

## **Prerequisites**
- **Install Jupyter**: Ensure Jupyter is installed on your system. You can install it using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install notebook
  ```
- **Install Python & Libraries**: Make sure you have Python and any required libraries installed.

---

## **Steps to Run an `.ipynb` File Locally**

### 1. **Open a Terminal/Command Prompt**
   - Navigate to the directory containing the `.ipynb` file using the `cd` command. For example:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/notebook
     ```

### 2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   - Run the following command to start the Jupyter Notebook server:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - This will open a web interface in your default browser.

### 3. **Select and Open the Notebook**
   - Locate the file in the interface and click on it to open.

### 4. **Run the Cells**
   - Use the **"Run"** button (▶️) in the toolbar or press `Shift + Enter` to execute each cell in the notebook.

## **Running in JupyterLab (Optional)**
JupyterLab offers a more modern interface:
1. Install JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab
   ```
2. Start it with:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

---

## **Running in Google Colab (Alternative)**
1. Upload the `.ipynb` file to Google Drive or Colab.
2. Open Colab and select **File > Upload Notebook**.
3. Run cells using `Shift + Enter`.

---

## **VS Code (Optional)**
1. Install the Python extension in VS Code.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file directly in VS Code.
3. Click **Run All** or run individual cells.
